# Game Industry Career Visualizations

This repository contains the python scripts we used to access the MobyGames API and the visualizations that we built to explore the data.

`/python` contains the data manipulation scripts.
`/visualization` contains the web-based visualizations.
Due to our licensing agreement with MobyGames, the data itself is elsewhere.

Start a webserver in the `/visualization` directory and access one of the html pages.
