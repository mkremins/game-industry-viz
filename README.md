# Game Industry Career Visualizations

This repository contains the python scripts we used to access the MobyGames API and the visualizations that we built to explore the data.

`/python` contains the data manipulation scripts.
`/visualizer` contains the web-based visualizations.
Due to our licensing agreement with MobyGames, the data itself is stored separately.

## To Run

1. Put the datfiles in the `/visualizer/data` directory.
2. Start a webserver in the `/visualizer` directory and access one of the html pages.
